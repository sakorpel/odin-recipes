# odin-recipes
A basic recipe website

Creating this website was my first HTML project. I was to add links to three different recipes on the index.html file. Each recipe has an image, unordered and ordered list, headlines, and a paragraph. I also added a link that takes the website user back to the main page (index.html) to make it better to use.

I found the project pretty simple to complete and didn't face any more significant issues. The biggest challenge I spent some time figuring out was the correct route to get to the images directory from the recipe file.

The project also taught me to use Git when programming. I found it challenging to know when and what to commit, and I was probably too general with the descriptions.
